Here comes my most recent music playlist.

This month's playlist features "The Phantom of the Opera" written by Andrew Lloyd Webber. The song is taken from his musical, [*The Phantom of the Opera*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phantom_of_the_Opera_(1986_musical)). Ms Chin, our English tutor, recommended the musical to us, and I love it, especially the melody.

"Daddy ! Daddy ! Do !" by Masayuki Suzuki (鈴木雅之, aka Martin), featuring Airi Suzuki (鈴木愛理), is another song I love. It is from the popular anime [*Kaguya-sama: Love Is War*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaguya-sama:_Love_Is_War), which I enjoy very much.

Basically, the further construction of this site has now been completed. In the future, when I have time, I will focus more on the contents. Adjustments will still be made when needed, but there will be fewer major changes.

I will write more posts in the future, including one about the further construction.
