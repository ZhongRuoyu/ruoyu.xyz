description: I have been thinking about why this blog should exist for a long, long while. Maybe this is the answer.

It occurred to me that this tiny blog has alredy been published for 6 months.

I admit it: initially, this site was just built for practicing my HTML and CSS skills. At that time, it was not completely my own work -- in fact, that was based on a template. By applying some modifications to that template, I gradually learned how to use Jekyll, and this blog was made available. I did not intend to make it a blog at that time; nor did I want to give it a meaningful domain (ruoyu.xyz).

It was some time later that I realised how large my social network was. I was looking for a place where I could put all those thoughts that were special to me, however small they might be, without worrying too much about who would read them, and how they would think about it.

Then *this* became the very place. I re-constructed the site from scratch, so that I could have full control on everything. I decided to make this site *meaningful*. I could decide what appear on the site, and how they should appear. While some posts are directly viewable, some are hidden, and kept secret to me (or maybe between you and me).

Yes, and you, my reader in front of the screen. Whoever you are, whether I know you or not, **thank you**. Thank you for reading my blog. Though it might not be written for you, thank you for knowing about me, a shy stranger from somewhere in the world. I am a little sorry for not having published enough updates, but I would only share something when I feel like.

And that's why this blog exists, and I believe it will continue to exist in the future.
