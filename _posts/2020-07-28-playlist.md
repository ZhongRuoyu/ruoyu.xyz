July is about to come to an end; the new semester is approaching. How time flies!

Taylor Swift's new album *folklore* has been a great surprise to me. Since I'm not a fan, I didn't expect it to be that good. -- I have to say, the Taylor Swift, back from pop music, is way better. In this new album, the track "exile" featuring Bon Iver is my favourite one.

I think I'm starting to get bored about the pop music filled with nonsense words. Maybe they're popular, but since they deliver hardly anything, they will soon be forgotten. I am now more fond of the tracks that really mean something to the writer/singer/audience.

As [Gaokao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_College_Entrance_Examination) ends, my friends are finally relieved of the burden at school, and have started to post their travel and party photos on social media. Having seen this, my mind has been filled up with mixed feelings. Words can't describe how I miss them and how I wish to join them.

Will I be able to fly back in December?
