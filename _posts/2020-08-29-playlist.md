description: Some thoughts about the new semester, and as usual, the August playlist.
---

It's been a while since I last updated. School started three weeks ago, and everything was fine -- it's just that I was too busy.

Apaer from my core CS courses, I have decided to take up linear algebra this year, in order to prepare myself for my maths minor studies. -- That wouldn't be enough, though. The classes were too simple, so I definitely need to learn more. Besides, I'm also planning to take up algorithms very soon. Indeed, should've done this earlier.

Lately I've also been enrolled in "[The Science of Well-Being](https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being)", a Coursera course offered by Yale University. I would certainly recommend this course -- now I feel that I have a more thorough understanding of happiness. Though it might seem impossible, it is indeed irrelevant to money and good grades.

As usual, here's the playlist for August. Nothing new -- just some old favourite songs this time.

-- And until next time.
