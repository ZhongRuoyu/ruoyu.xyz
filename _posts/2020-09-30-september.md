description: End-of-September thoughts.
---

Haven't updated my blog for a long, long while. To me, the past month has been happy, but busy and unsteady as well. I have been experiencing internal and external pressure all over me, and for once I felt so low.

Had a silent walk tonight, throwing all thoughts out of my mind. Though not relieved yet, I know I need to hold on.

It **will** be better.
