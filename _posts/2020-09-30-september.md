description: End-of-September thoughts.

Haven't updated my blog for a long, long while. To me, the past month has been happy, but busy and unsteady as well. I have been experiencing high pressure, and for once I felt so low.

Anyway, to me, it was still very meaningful.

Had a silent walk tonight, throwing all my thoughts out of my mind. The stars were so bright, and the night was so peaceful. Felt as if I really escaped from the very moment, and from all the stuff that bothered me...

... And it was over.

Hopefully, when October starts, everything will be better.

Had a terrible dream last night. A hard rain's gonna fall.

Let the storm break.<!-- Though I fear it. -->

Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

Good night! Good night.
