description: My music playlist for March & April 2020. Also my first blog post.

Yes. This is my very first blog post. I'm still making some adjustments to the very new site.

As a music fan, I'd like to begin my blog with my most recent music playlist. Usually, I create a music playlist every month (or two months). This is the playlist created a month ago.

Among these songs, MIKA's "Ice Cream" is perhaps my favourite.

This song is typical of his music -- the one that would make you feel like dancing. Hope you like it.

While the whole world is fighting COVID-19 together, do stay home and stay safe.

Also, stay tuned for future posts! ;)
