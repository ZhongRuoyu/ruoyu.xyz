While doing my C/C++ assignment, I suddenly felt like creating a C/C++ function which can read integers from the input buffer, and has a good management of invalid input. Then I created the function `getint()` using [`getchar()`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/getchar).

It has the following features:

* It can omit all the whitespaces before and after the integer.
* It does a cleanup to prevent malfunction due to invalid input.
* It can provide error information through a pointer parameter. (In C++, it is `NULL` by default; in C, if no error information is needed, a `NULL` pointer needs to be provided.)

After creating it, I have been told that there are quite a number of similar functions existing already. But still I decided to put it here. It is also available in [GitHub](https://github.com/ZhongRuoyu/getint). When you find bugs or areas of improvement, please feel free to point them out by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/ZhongRuoyu/getint/issues/new/choose).
