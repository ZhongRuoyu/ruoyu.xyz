This month's playlist features *All These Things That I've Done* by The Killers. This song was recommended to me a couple of weeks ago by Apple Music. Surprisingly, it became one of my inspirations during the very difficult time in September.

Maybe the month does not seem as steady as what it should be (or maybe it's just too steady). <!--That's alright. We *can* go through this, and we *will*... -->But after all, that's only the beginning of the battle.

May we be *warriors*.

By the way, I've been developing my interest in classical music for quite a long time. Recently, I have been appreciating Beethoven's Symphony No. 7. The version included in this playlist, the one recorded in 1976 by Wiener Philharmoniker and Carlos Kleiber, has been widely regarded as one of those *truly classic recordings*. It is well worth appreciating.
