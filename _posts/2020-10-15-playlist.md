This month's playlist features *All These Things That I've Done* by The Killers. This song was recommended to me a couple of weeks ago by Apple Music. Surprisingly, it became one of my inspirations during the very difficult time in September.

> I got soul but I'm not a soldier...

Maybe the month does not seem as steady as what it should be (or maybe it's just too steady). <!--That's alright. We *can* go through this, and we *will*... -->But after all, that's only the beginning of the battle.

*May we be warriors.*

By the way, I've been developing my interest in classical music for quite a long time. Recently, I have been appreciating Beethoven's Symphony No. 7. The version included in this playlist, recorded in 1976 by Wiener Philharmoniker and Carlos Kleiber, has been widely regarded as one of those *truly classic recordings*. It is well worth appreciating.
