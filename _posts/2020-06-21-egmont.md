description: Accidentally found a great version of overture to Egmont.

I accidentally found a great version of overture to *Egmont*. It is performed by Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela, and conducted by Venezuela-born maestro [Gustavo Dudamel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustavo_Dudamel).

This version has a steady tempo; the instruments are in a peaceful harmony. What's worth mentioning is that compared to the version by Boston Symphony Orchestra and Seiji Ozawa, as I mentioned in [an earlier post](/music/2020-06/playlist/), I prefer the tone of the woodwinds in this version; it sounds even more tuneful.
