description: The first stage of construction of this site is finally finished.
---

I am very happy to let you know that after hours of work, the (first stage of) construction of this site is finally finished! Here is some of the work:

* [About](/about) information added & styles improved (And I've created a [Chinese version](/zh/about) too!);
* [Music](/music) category added & several associated source code improvements;
* New fonts applied: [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) and [Source Code Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro), two of my favourites[^1];
* Some code optimisation;
* Some hidden information added (where is it?);
* â€¦

However, there are still some improvements to be made. For instance, before this post is posted, the [Blog](/blog) section was empty. We should have expected to see a message "Nothing published yet.", but it wasn't shown.

HTML is still very new to me, but in the past few hours I have learned so much about it. I can now understand its powerfulness. Though not as powerful as HTML, Markdown is also a very useful tool for creating contents (like this post) quickly.

There are still several minor issues in the site. I will have them gradually solved.

[^1]: Update: due to an compatibility issue, the fonts have been changed to [Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans) and [Noto Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Serif). For the monospace font family, it uses a series of default fonts on different systems to ensure the quality of display.
