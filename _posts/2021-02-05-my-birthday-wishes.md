description: How I wish my last year as a teenager to be a meaningful one.
---

'Twas just another day, but another remarkable one, too.

I haven't updated my blog for a while. I was finally home, back to the place where I always wanted to go. It was terribly hard to travel overseas at the moment, but that also made the trip even more meaningful. It's sad, though, that I'm not sure when I can be back again.

But I feel like writing something *now*. This will be my last year as a teenager. It's strange, somehow, that I don't feel old. I've been consistently asking myself what I wanted my life to be, but I still haven't found a satisfactory answer. You see, I've been living, I've been learning, I've been developing my programming skills (which I enjoyed very much), I've been making friends; I've always been trying to make my life more *meaningful*. I do have goals; I am just not sure about which the *ultimate* one would be. "To live a better life" sounds just too vague for me.

So far, my best answer would be, "to learn, to crave excellency, and to ________".

I hope I can enjoy my last year as a teenager. Hope I can find an ultimate answer some day -- perhaps it'll take long, but I won't stop until I complete the blank, or even find a better answer.

*Happy birthday to me.*
