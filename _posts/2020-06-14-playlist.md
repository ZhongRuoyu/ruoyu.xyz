My music playlist for this month.

"Egmont Overture, Op. 64" is featured in this month's playlist. It's a great music piece composed by Ludwig van Beethoven. This version is performed by Boston Symphony Orchestra, and conducted by [Seiji Ozawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiji_Ozawa) (小澤征爾). It's perhaps my favourite version.

Well, I may not be able to fully *appreciate* western classical music, but I do listen to a lot of great pieces. To me, *listening* to them is the most enjoyable part.

Until next time.
