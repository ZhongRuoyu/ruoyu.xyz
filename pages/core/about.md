Welcome to my site!

I'm Ruoyu, a first year student studying computer science at [Nanyang Technological University, Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/).

This site is where I post my thoughts, share my favourite music, etc. There are currently 2 sections: [Blog](/blog/) and [Projects](/projects/). You can also see [here](/tags/) for a list of tagged posts.

This site was created on 25 April 2020. The current version, developed by myself based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), was published on 24 July 2020. In addition, the domain ruoyu.xyz was put into use on 16 July 2020.
